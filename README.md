# SocialSnapper

React app for scraping download links from Social Media websites like Reddit, Instagram, and Youtube. For people who are tired of pay-walls and ads when all they want to do is download a picture of a puppy.

Reddit serves video and audio files separately so I've built a sister-website for combining the two files into one.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
